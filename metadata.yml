description: Calculate the uv-vis absorption spectrum of a small molecule.
methods: |
  This workflow first samples the conformations of a given molecule 
  at finite temperature using the GAFF forcefield with AM1-BCC charges, then
  uses CAS(6x6)-SA3 to calculate the lowest excited state transition transition
  moment.
